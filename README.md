# OpenAI Gym ZOO

This repository is home for some artificial intelligence algorithms and other creatures that tries to solve [OpenAI Gym Challanges](https://gym.openai.com/)


### CartPole_AI_1

This algorithm tries to solve the [CartPole Challenge](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0) using a feed forward neural network, trained using a stochastic optimization algorithm know as [Cross-Entropy Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy_method).
